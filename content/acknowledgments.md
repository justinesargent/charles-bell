This short project is a culmination of my time at the Getty and it could not have been accomplished without the resources made readily available to me by the Getty Research Institute. My internship supervisors Ruth Lane and Molly McGeehan were extraordinarily supportive throughout my internship. They kindly met with me weekly to provide internship and professional guidance. Special thanks as well to Greg Albers and Erin Dunigan, who provided invaluable help in developing my Quire project. My thanks as well to the entirety of the staff at Getty Publications, who warmly welcomed me to the department and were supportive throughout my short tenure.
