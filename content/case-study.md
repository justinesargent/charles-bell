>A surgeon by profession, Sir Charles Bell was an artist by predilection: that acute sensibility which rendered the practice of surgery painful to himself, induced him to find relief during the contemplation of human suffering in tracing the contortions of agony to their source…
-- Review of Anatomy of Expression in The Spectator, 1844[^1]

Originally published in 1806, *Essays on the Anatomy of Expression in Painting*, later released as *The Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression* (1824), offers a detailed inquiry into “how a wide range of emotions manifest themselves in face and figure.”[^2] The work was targeted toward both artists and anatomists who were interested in understanding the neurological and physiological structures and processes that underpinned facial expression. According to the preface in the posthumously published third edition, “it was his artistic interest in the depiction of expression that led him to his successes in anatomy and neurology.”[^3] His seminal work reflected extensive observations on facial anatomy, which thus lead to his finding of a condition where “damage to the facial nerve in the brain leads to paralysis on the corresponding side of the body.”[^4]

It is important to note that like many scientific contemporaries of the time, such findings were brought about by what would now be regarded as highly unethical, if not directly harmful, practices of medical experimentation and hypothesis. In his findings for Bell’s palsy, Charles experimented on animals “to probe the connections between nerves and muscles.”[^5]

On "Muscles of the face," a reviewer of Bell's book discussed how: “This is one of Bell’s most famous drawings and a work of great beauty. Charles bell was probably happier drawing dissections than anything else.”[^6]

In *Essays*, Charles contends that “the ancient models often imitated by painters did not accurately reflect anatomical realities,” thus once again using his artistic skills to render the body accurately in medical studies.[^7] He supposedly argued against the reliance on antiques and models as they displayed “posture not action.”[^8] Other artists such as David Wilkie also contributed illustrations after Charles’ death.[^9] Writ large, the work was a success. Charles' anatomist contemporaries such as John Flaxman, Henry Fuseli, and Charles Darwin supposedly thought highly of the work.[^10]

Despite Charles’ known successes related to his findings for Bell’s palsy and Bell’s law, among others, *The Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression* has somewhat fallen into obscurity. The work is striking in that it not merely functions as a descriptive text for anatomy and its study, but also as a manuscript to express his own philosophies and tenets, such as his belief that “expression is to passion what language is to thought.”[^11] See below the engraving “Madman,” of which he described:

>“If I were to set down what ought to be represented as the prevailing character of a madman, I should say, that his body should be strong, and his muscles rigid and distinct; his skin bound; his features sharp, his eyes sunk; his color a dark brownish yellow, tinctured with sallowness, without one spot of enlivening carnation; his hair sooty black, stiff and bushy. Or perhaps he might be represented as of a pale sickly yellow, with wiry red hair.”[^12]

As was characteristic of much of early nineteenth-century medicine in Europe, Charles’ observations were heavily racially encoded, which reflected the inaccurate and racist conceptions of human anatomy that were elevated, during the period, to universal medical truth. His physiognomic examinations indicated the growing resurgence of physiognomy as a crucial tool for diagnosis, rooted in seventeenth-century medical inquiry. Thus, symptoms that were characteristic of insanity were associated with certain facial features. For Charles, his imagined Madman would not only have “sharp” features and “sunken” eyes, but also “dark brownish yellow” skin with “hair sooty black, stiff and bushy.”

The doctor’s methodology lies on the intersection of art and science, thus making apparent the inherent subjectivity of a supposedly objective scientific practice. Charles’ efforts in this work, as he argued, were those of de-aestheticization. Both Charles and John claimed to portray the body in its actuality, providing their own forms as tools for visual study. However, this subjective, qualitative analysis of “madness,” a neurology generalized through a racialized body and visual, presents the problematic legacies that Western medicine inherits and arguably still perpetuates in its practice. Nonetheless, through Charles’ study, it becomes quite apparent how nascent the fields of neurology and neurophysiology were during his time, as well as the extraordinary lengths that medicine had yet to come.
