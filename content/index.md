In this short **Quire** project, I provide a brief biographical overview of the life and career of **Sir Charles Bell (1774-1842)**, a renowned physician and anatomical artist. I use his book *Anatomy of Expression in Painting* (1806), later republished as *The Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression in Painting* (1824) as a case study of Charles Bell’s work. In the Afterword, I discuss my experience examining the book at Getty Research Institute’s Special Collections and my experience working on the project. This short work is a meant as a cursory examination of Charles Bell’s work and was completed as part of the 2023 Getty Marrow Undergraduate Internship with **Getty Publications**.
