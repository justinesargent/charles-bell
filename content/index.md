In this short **Quire** project, I provide a brief biographical overview of the life and career of **Sir Charles Bell (1774-1842)**, a renowned Scottish physician and anatomical artist. I use Bell's book *Anatomy of Expression in Painting* (1806), later republished as *The Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression in Painting* (1824) as a case study of his work. This short project was completed as part of the 2023 Getty Marrow Undergraduate Internship with **Getty Publications**.
