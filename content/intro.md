Sir Charles Bell (1774-1842) is chiefly known for his work as a neurophysiologist and a surgeon.  As part of his humanistic inquiry, Charles believed that “dissection was key to understanding the human body,” utilizing art as a tool of medical pedagogy.  He used his own illustrations and anatomical wax models for teaching.  During his career, Charles made important discoveries in determining the nervous system’s sensory functions and was an early advocate in the idea that parts of the brain controlled specific functions. His primary contributions are related to his findings for Bell’s palsy, or “facial paralysis caused by nerve dysfunction.”  He is also attributed to Bell’s law.

Born and raised in Edinburgh, Scotland, Charles attended the University of Edinburgh alongside his brother, John Bell (1763-1820).  In his younger years, Charles studied drawing under the painter David Allan.  He would later apply his skills as a contributing writer and artist to John’s The Anatomy of the Human Body (1797), as well as his own A System of Dissection. John was regarded for two decades to have been one of “the leading operating surgeon in Britain and throughout the world,” and Charles a “distinguished anatomist and physiologist of his day.”  Charles became a Fellow of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons in 1799.

As a character, Charles was described as having “a little too much ambition” and “a small degree of misanthropy,” according to his friend Francis Jeffrey.  Moreover, this ambition was reflected in the numerous works he produced over the course of his career, such as in Engravings of the Arteries (1801), through which Charles aimed to “present to the student at once the glance the general distribution of vessels and to fix them in his memory.”  The book contains ten engravings (see below).

In 1804 after the closure of John’s school, Bell began his life in London and published books on the anatomy of the brain.  It was also during this period when he began his manuscript Anatomy of Expression in Painting, which would later be published in 1806.  Charles soon opened a school of anatomy (which utilized bodies obtained from gave robberies, as was the common practice of the time), which would come to increase Charles’ pedagogical and surgical practice.  In 1809, Charles published System of Operative Surgery and tended wounded soldiers in Portsmouth.

Charles’ treatment of soldiers in 1809, men who were wounded from the battle with Napoleon’s army at La Coruna, heralded the beginning of his series of artistic portrayals of battle wounds and treatments. These tormented visages would come to haunt him throughout his career. In a letter to a friend, Charles wrote:

“It is impossible to convey to you the picture of human misery continually before my eyes. What was heart-rending in the day, was intolerable at night…while I amputated one man’s thigh, there lay at one time thirteen, all beseeching to be taken next…” 

Both staunch realists, Charles and John “forcefully promoted realism in anatomical illustration,” railing against the supposed “vitious practice of drawing from imagination.”  Their methodology of portraying the dead was heavily scrutinized across the field of anatomical art. For example, a contemporary of Charles, the Scottish anatomist and physician Robert Knox (1791-1862), found Charles’ artistic methodology profoundly “harmful.” He declared that the “artist should never draw a dissected muscle,” and rather show the “example of a living body… or antique sculpture.”  Thus, even the dead were still held to perfectionist standards of aesthetics, striving toward perfection passively through death.

In a striking effort toward artistic realism, John used himself as a reference in his drawings for his own book of anatomy The Anatomy of the Bones, Muscles, and Joints (1793).  He etched himself as various cadavers on dissecting tables among the “ropes and props” of the dissecting room.  Charles and John had extraordinary foresight in their efforts toward representation, declaring that a book of anatomy empty of illustrations seemed “no better than a book of geography without its maps.”  In 1810, Charles became preoccupied with the nervous system, examining convulsions related to spinal nerves, and published his findings in a pamphlet for friends and colleagues.  In 1822, French physiologist François Magendie (1783-1855) conducted more advanced and astute vivisection-based studies on spinal nerves, to which Charles “did not behave admirably” towards. 

Shortly after his takeover of a different school of anatomy, Charles was admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons and thus in 1814 was appointed to the surgical staff of surgeons at Middlesex Hospital.  In 1815, Charles and his brother-in-law John Shaw operated on wounded soldiers at the Battle of Waterloo, which he recorded in a series of visceral sketches and watercolors.  

Charles sold his school in 1825, was elected to the Royal Society in 1826, and was awarded a Royal Medal in 1829.  A decade later he accepted the chair of surgery in Edinburgh, though his bout as teacher and surgeon was riddled with emotional and physical torment caused by acute angina.   He passed away April 28, 1842.
